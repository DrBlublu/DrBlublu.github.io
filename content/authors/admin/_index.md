#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

In my research, I explore the impact of language on cultural evolution using experimental and computational approaches. My PhD work investigated the neurocognitive foundations of cumulative technological culture, examining how human tools are transmitted and understood.

 

Currently, my research focuses on the hypothesis that language enables us to convey our mental models of the world, thereby facilitating cultural evolution. I use reinforcement learning frameworks and large language models to study how written advice and communication enhance culture over generations. This work aims to illuminate the processes by which language shapes our cultural and adaptive behaviours.
